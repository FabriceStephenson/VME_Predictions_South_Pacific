1.Functions.R  - contains functions used in subsequent R scripts
2.TrainingModels.R – code for ensemble modelling (Random Forest; Boosted Regression Tree and Maxent) using training data
3.Validation.R – code for assessing model fit metrics of ensemble models fitted using training data and using independent evaluation data
4.FinalModels.R – code for ensemble modelling (Random Forest; Boosted Regression Tree and Maxent) using all available data (training data and evaluation data)
